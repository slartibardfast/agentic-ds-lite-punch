# UPGRADING.md: the version-to-version upgrade ledger

Adopting the methodology records a template revision in `.host`. The
template then moves on, and an adopted repo must **upgrade** across the revision
span. The upgrade re-applies spine doc changes *and* the **structural migrations** the span
introduced (a re-embedding of the software, a tool bump). A `git diff` of the
template shows the prose; it does not say "convert the submodule" or "untrack a
symlink". This ledger does.

Apply every entry below whose revision is **newer** than your stamp.
`host-lifecycle upgrade <dir>` prints exactly those, decided by git ancestry
against this template, so same-day revisions order correctly. Fetch the template
to the target revision first; then apply the list and re-stamp. Each entry is
keyed by the template revision at which its action became required.

## What a `verify` condition must test

An entry's `verify` is re-run twice over: by `upgrade --record` when the entry is
applied, and by `software --check` on every gate run thereafter. It is a standing claim
about the adopter's tree, not a check of the upgrade procedure.

Every entry added from here on obeys four rules.

1. **Test the adopter's side**: their tree, their recipe, or their running binary. Never
   a file under `host-template/`: `upgrade` requires the template fetched at the target
   revision before it will run, so such a condition is a post-condition of the command's
   own precondition. It can neither refuse a false record nor detect a revert.
2. **Test what the tool guarantees, not what the entry is about.** Build a tree that
   SHOULD fail the condition and confirm it fails. A condition stricter than its own
   action leaves a correct adopter permanently unable to record, with no remedy.
3. **One command, no shell operators.** Conditions run through `sh -c` on POSIX and
   `cmd /C` on Windows; a pipe, a `!`, or a `grep` does not survive the second. Prefer a
   mode that answers for itself, such as `host-lifecycle capability <name>`.
4. **Accept a tree the entry's own gate would redden.** The condition asks whether the
   entry was applied, never whether the project is clean. Requiring clean wedges an
   adopter whose one offending line sits in a record they must not rewrite.

Entries written before this rule mostly grep `host-template/` and are weak in the sense
of rule 1. They are **not** amended. An entry is a contract with claims already recorded
against it in adopters' `.host-receipts`, and tightening one retroactively can convert a
correctly applied upgrade into a standing HAZARD on a tree its owner cannot fix. Where
such an entry's guarantee genuinely needs checking, check it from a NEW entry that names
the old one in `depends`. This header is the exception to the file's append-only rule,
because no recorded claim re-checks it: amend the header, never an entry.

[upgrade "8c28e33"]
    title    = Software is a bare store with worktrees (call/0004)
    action   = Convert the embedded gitlink submodule to a bare store + worktrees (see the `host` repo, converting an existing submodule): preserve the pin, de-register the gitlink, write .host-software, gitignore the trees, then `host-lifecycle software --materialize`.
    requires = host-lifecycle v0.3.0

[upgrade "325f2cf"]
    title    = Worktree-absence coherence (call/0005)
    action   = Untrack artifacts that depend on the worktree (skill symlinks into the software path); gitignore them and recreate after materialize. Keep an un-materialized CI job green. `host-lifecycle software --check` must report no HAZARD.
    requires = host-lifecycle v0.3.1

[upgrade "71d12a8"]
    title    = Coherence generalized to tool submodules (call/0005)
    action   = Re-run `host-lifecycle software --check` (now flags any tracked symlink whose target is not tracked here, not just software-worktree paths). Untrack any flagged tool-skill symlinks and generate them instead (the link-skills.sh pattern); keep them gitignored.
    requires = host-lifecycle v0.4.1

[upgrade "bbbfdc3"]
    title    = Reserve agentic-host for the meta repo; stamp is `.host`, scaffold is `host-template`
    action   = Rename your `.agentic-host` stamp to `.host`. Re-point your `template-agentic-host` submodule and its URL to `host-template`. A repo that adopts the methodology is "an agentic project" (e.g. `agentic-acme`); `agentic-host` now names only the meta repo.
    requires = host-lifecycle v0.5.0

[upgrade "7ae93cd"]
    title    = Publish via `host-lifecycle book` (the canonical doc-site publisher)
    action   = Replace any hand-rolled mdBook generator/SUMMARY with `host-lifecycle book .`; it writes book.toml (src = "docs", never ".") + docs/ in lifecycle order, renders specs, and emits a Where stub from .host-software. Run `host-lifecycle book . && host-lifecycle book --check .` before `mdbook build` (see .github/workflows/site.yml); gitignore the generated book.toml/docs/.
    requires = host-lifecycle v0.6.1

[upgrade "6db01f3"]
    title    = Anti-ouroboros: call/ is for the software, methodology lives in the spine
    action   = The methodology is owned by the spine (copy-at-version), not your call/. In a single dedicated commit, set `Status: superseded by the spine` on every accepted call/ decision that merely restates a methodology rule now settled upstream (leave the file in place, since MADR records are immutable). Add a `Scope:` header to each remaining accepted decision. Do not treat any host/management repo's top-level instance rooms as normative. `host-lifecycle validate <call-dir>` now fails an accepted decision missing `Scope:` or declaring `Scope: methodology`.
    requires = host-lifecycle v0.7.0

[upgrade "07025a7"]
    title    = book publisher v0.7.1: nested specs + retired-decision Archive
    action   = Bump your pinned `host-lifecycle book` revision to v0.7.1. Two rendering changes follow on the next build: specs nested in `spec/<topic>/` now render (previously dropped), and decisions whose MADR `Status:` is superseded/deprecated/rejected move into a trailing "Archive / Record" section (banner + nav-label suffix) instead of shipping as current chapters. The record signal is `Status:` only; `.host-lintignore` does not affect the book.
    requires = host-lifecycle v0.7.1

[upgrade "e3b174d"]
    title    = Reproducible builds are the production anchor
    action   = Record build provenance in `.host-software` per component: `build` + `toolchain` (the deterministic recipe), `deploy` (which line ships), and `artifact = <worktree-path> <sha256>`. Add a CI job that runs `host-lifecycle software --verify-build` (rebuild from the pin; fail unless the artifact reproduces); see the reference `.github/workflows/reproducible-build.yml`. Software initiated under the methodology must reproduce. Pre-existing software not yet reproducible may carry `repro-exempt = call/NNNN` citing a software-scoped case decision; the exemption is retired as it converges and is never available to greenfield software.
    requires = host-lifecycle v0.8.0

[upgrade "c137567"]
    title    = Per-platform builds for multi-platform software
    action   = For a component whose one source pin ships on several platforms, replace the flat single-build fields with one `[build "<name>" "<platform>"]` subsection per platform under its `[software "<name>"]` stanza, each with its own `build`/`toolchain`/`artifact`/`deploy` (and optional `repro-exempt`) plus an `attest-host` naming the OS (`linux`/`windows`/`macos`) that reproduces it. `host-lifecycle software --check`/`--verify-build` then attest each build only on its `attest-host`, skipping foreign-host builds rather than failing. Single-platform components need no change: the flat form stays valid.

    title    = --check artifact mismatch is a note, not a failure
    action   = Bump your pinned `host-lifecycle` revision to v0.9.1. `software --check` no longer hard-fails when a present artifact's hash differs from the recorded canonical hash (a local-toolchain build legitimately differs); it prints a `note` instead, the way `--install-hooks` already does. A match still reports `verified`; `--verify-build` (the container/CI lane) remains the reproducibility proof. No recipe change is required; this only removes a dev-box false failure.

[upgrade "b6232a5"]
    title    = Specs live with the software, not the host plan tree
    action   = Move any behaviour (.allium) or timing (.tla) specs out of the host's `plan/<milestone>/spec/` and into the software repo, beside the code they constrain. Add the verification lane to the *software's* CI, not the host's: allium gated with both `allium check` and `allium analyse` (install `allium-cli@3.4.2`; both exit non-zero on any error or warning), and specula/TLC (`tla2tools v1.8.0` on a Temurin `21` JDK). Remove the host's spec copies and its specula workflow; leave a forward note in the affected milestone. The host `plan/<milestone>/` now references a spec by path and software pin rather than containing it.
    requires = host-lifecycle v0.9.1

[upgrade "c771d60"]
    title    = Verification lanes are mandatory when a spec of their kind exists
    action   = Wire the lane tools you use as submodules and generate their skills (gitignored) with `link-skills.sh`: `tools/allium` (+ its elicit/distill/tend/weed/propagate skills) for any `.allium`, `tools/specula` for any `.tla`. Author and maintain `.allium` specs THROUGH the skills, not by hand. In the *software* repo's CI, gate each `.allium` with `allium check` + `allium analyse` + `allium plan` (install `allium-cli@3.4.2`; both check and analyse exit non-zero on any error or warning) and discharge the `plan` test obligations with the suite; TLC-check each `.tla` (`tla2tools v1.8.0` on Temurin `21`). The lane is conditional (TLA+ stays optional until a `.tla` exists, allium until a `.allium` exists), but a spec present without its full lane is a defect, not a choice. Do not treat the lanes as reference decoration.

[upgrade "b8c54fc"]
    title    = The spec-lane MUST is enforced by software --check
    action   = Bump your pinned host-lifecycle to v0.10.0. `host-lifecycle software --check` now raises a HAZARD when a materialized component carries a `.allium` spec with no CI workflow running `allium check` + `allium analyse`, or a `.tla` with no TLC lane (`tlc2.TLC`/`tla2tools`). Wire the missing lane (per the previous entry) so --check is clean; an un-materialized worktree is skipped.

    title    = Allium plan obligations must be dispositioned per component

Run `host-lifecycle obligations <spec> --tests <dir>` in the software's CI (it fails on any undispositioned/stale obligation or absent test ref). Bump host-lifecycle to v0.11.1, where `software --check` also HAZARDs a `.allium` with no `.obligations` manifest.

    action   = Bump tools/host-lifecycle and run link-skills.sh so the phase skills (classify, adopt, embed, remap, verify, publish, upgrade) appear under .claude/skills/ alongside the allium/specula skills. Operate the methodology through these phases and their commands, never ad-hoc; the phases cover scaffolding, embedding, migration, verification, publishing, and upgrading. Unlike a verification lane, this is unconditional: there is no opt-out, and hand-operating any phase is a defect.

    action   = Audit your tools and software for version bumps that were never tagged (`git tag` vs the manifest `version`); back-fill an annotated `vX.Y.Z` tag at each bump commit and push it. From now on, every version bump is committed with its matching tag, pushed alongside; the tag is the release a `v*` CI workflow builds. Do not re-pin `.host-software` or a tool pointer to a version-bumped commit that has no matching tag.

    title    = Never adopt a software repository in place
    action   = Bump your pinned host-lifecycle to v0.12.0 and re-run the classify phase as the first step of any adoption. `host-lifecycle classify <dir>` now refuses (exits non-zero, prints the embedding steps) when the target is itself a software repository (a root build manifest (`Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml`, …) with no `.host` stamp and no `.host-software` recipe) instead of printing a case letter. A host is a separate meta-repo; the software is embedded as its Where room. If you previously adopted a methodology host directly on top of a software repo, split them: move the code into a bare store with worktrees recorded in the host's `.host-software`, so the host root carries only the rooms and config.

    action   = Bump your pinned host-lifecycle to v0.13.0. Audit `.host-software` for any worktree whose path escapes the host root (an absolute or `..`-climbing `worktrees`/`worktree` entry, or a Where-room worktree materialized at a disjoint external path with no in-structure handle). Bring each under the root: for a store that must live off-tree (another filesystem or platform), record it on the parallel line as `worktree = <dir> <branch> <pin> store=<path> [host=<os>]` and re-run `software --materialize`, which realises the store at `<path>` and the in-tree `<dir>` as a symlink/junction to it. `software --check` now HAZARDs an escaping path and a `store=` line whose in-tree handle is missing or does not resolve to the store; `host=` gates a line to one OS so a foreign-OS CI skips it rather than failing.

    title    = Honest partial upgrades: the applied-set stamp model
    action   = Bump your pinned host-lifecycle to v0.14.0. The `.host` stamp now records what is applied as a `baseline` ledger entry (every entry at or before its position in this file counts applied) plus an optional `applied` set of out-of-order entries, keyed by ledger position, never git ancestry. Your first `host-lifecycle upgrade` migrates a legacy single-`revision` stamp once (derives the baseline; no manual edit). Thereafter: `upgrade` lists pending by position, `upgrade --next` prints the single next safe action, and you record an applied entry with `host-lifecycle upgrade --record <id>` (id, unambiguous prefix, or ledger ordinal), which validates the id, refuses if a `depends` is unapplied, runs the entry's `verify` post-condition or requires `--unverified call/NNNN`, and appends an append-only claim. Never hand-edit the stamp. A late `independent` entry may be cherry-applied without an earlier unrelated one (deferred entries stay pending and re-list, so a forgotten or premature record can never hide owed work); `upgrade --advance` compacts a contiguous applied run into the baseline; `software --check` re-checks every recorded claim.

    title    = Deeper verification rungs: Apalache (symbolic), TLAPS (proof), Kani (code-conformance)
    action   = Bump your pinned host-lifecycle to v0.15.0. The verification ladder gains opt-in deeper rungs above the bounded lanes, driven by a referenced `tools/host-prove` submodule (wire it and run `link-skills.sh` only if you use a rung; its `apalache-symbolic`, `tlaps-proof` and `kani-conformance` skills turn each verifier into a one-line verdict). An obligation may now be dispositioned `kani:<harness>`, `apalache:<inv>` or `tlaps:<theorem>` instead of `test:`/`structural`/`waived:`, since a proof discharges it for all inputs/parameters; `host-lifecycle obligations <spec> --prove <dir>` validates that the named proof exists. Declaring a rung obliges its CI lane: `software --check` now HAZARDs an obligation that declares `kani:` with no `cargo kani` lane, `apalache:` with no `apalache-mc` lane, or `tlaps:` with no `tlapm` lane. Nothing is required until you declare a rung, and bare `.tla`/crate presence never activates one. Route a parametric or unbounded `.tla` invariant to Apalache/TLAPS, and a code-conformance claim to your language's verifier (Rust uses Kani); prefer byte/char-level Kani targets (`str::split`/`Vec` blow CBMC up). Verifiers install from official prebuilt binaries pinned by version + SHA256; no Docker.

If your software detects the patterns the hygiene lane flags (a linter, parser, validator, grammar tool), it embeds them in test fixtures, docs and sometimes source, the legitimate self-reference the git hook would block. Exclude that corpus through `.host-lintignore` (host-lint v0.4.1+ honors it in the per-file hook scan, not only the `--all` walk), validated file-by-file so no real tell hides among the examples; keep ordinary source scanned (reword an example comment rather than mute the file). Never `--no-verify` past the gate to land a fixture; that silently defeats the lane. Finally, keep the template's own `tools/host-lifecycle` pin at or above the maximum `requires` in this ledger, so the pinned tool can actually run the ledger it ships.

    title    = Sound discharge by re-derivation (call/0018) + the LEXICON provenance allowlist
    action   = Bump your pinned host-lifecycle to v0.18.1, host-lint to v0.6.0, and (if you run a deeper rung) host-prove to v0.2.0. A rung obligation is now discharged by RE-DERIVATION, not name-presence: `host-lifecycle obligations <spec> --rederive <dir>` re-runs each `kani:`/`apalache:`/`tlaps:` rung through host-prove in its recorded pinned toolchain and requires a PASS at the declared bound (AVAILABLE != DISCHARGED). The offline `--prove` check stays, honestly a name-presence lint. Add the cheap offline staleness signal by declaring `inputs=<files>` on a rung and recording `<manifest>.digests` with `--rederive --record-digests`; a later offline run reports STALE if the proven inputs drift without a fresh re-derivation. Enforcement is project-pluggable (a required check, any CI, a pre-push hook, or the operator's verify phase): no keys, no CI lock-in; it generalizes the reproducible-build re-derivation so that proofs are re-derived the way artifacts are. For the hygiene lane, declare legitimate tell-shaped tokens in a `LEXICON` (each the full contextual phrase, masked; a tracker reference carries its URL); `host-lifecycle adopt` seeds a comment-only scaffold. Because a sound escape now exists, the identifier/reference tier may escalate warn to flag via a committed `host-lint: strict` directive, and `host-lint: jira-key PROJ` opts a project key into citation-gating. Curate with `host-lint lexicon add` (it refuses a master key, a laundered tell, or an un-cited reference); `host-lint lexicon --check-urls` re-derives URL liveness in a network lane.

The hygiene lane gains a per-block escape for a document that must reproduce a tell verbatim: a fenced code block tagged `host-lint:ignore` (markdown only). Its lines are skipped by the naming scan while the rest of the file stays linted, and a regular code block or inline backticks stay scanned so a tell cannot be laundered by quoting it. Reserve it for an irreducible literal citation (an old-name remap table, a frozen dated review citing another document's numbered steps); reword a pedagogical example or a document's own ordinal label into content, and path-exclude (`.host-lintignore`) only the immutable record (the append-only memory log, dated review artifacts) and the self-referential corpus. This loosens, never widens, the gate: it replaces blanket path-exclusion of editable docs with in-file, per-block, still-audited boxing.

The lifecycle phases (their order, modality, command and the evidence each carries) now live once in a tool-readable `lifecycle.manifest` at the template root (the CLAUDE.md/STRUCTURE.md prose point at it instead of re-typing the order), and a `release` phase is added (the strict, tool-carried release: verify, build in the recorded toolchain, re-derive the artifact hash, re-pin, tag, receipt). The rule changes from "every phase runs, no opt-out" to **every phase emits a receipt**: `host-lifecycle receipt --record <phase> [--component <c>] --disposition done|skip` writes an append-only `.host-receipts`, and `host-lifecycle software --check` now HAZARDs any manifest phase with no receipt, re-verifying each `done` by the manifest's closed `recheck =` (never the receipt's own say-so). Modality is first-class: a `conditional-on-Where` phase is tool-computed `n-a` where the project has no Where room, a `recurring-per-component` phase (embed, release) is receipted once per component, and a protected core (`verify`, `skippable = false`) refuses a skip. Back-fill a receipt for each phase your project has already done; `host-lifecycle manifest <path>` prints the whole lifecycle at a glance.

    title    = The Where room uses the nested software/<name>/<branch> layout
    action   = Bump your pinned host-lifecycle to v0.19.0. The Where room now materializes under `software/<name>/`: the bare store at `software/<name>/.git` and each worktree keyed by branch at `software/<name>/<branch>/` (the canonical worktree is the recorded `branch`, default `main`, checked out at the pin), replacing the old root-scattered `<name>/`, `<name>.git/`, `<name>.<line>/`. Migrate, in order: (1) replace the per-component `.gitignore` triplets with a single `/software/` entry; (2) remove the old root-scattered worktrees and bare stores (commit or stash any uncommitted parallel-worktree work first, since re-materialize is destructive); (3) run `host-lifecycle software --materialize .` to realise the new tree; (4) re-run `link-skills.sh` and re-point any software skill link at `software/<name>/<branch>/`; then `host-lifecycle software --check .` must be clean. The `worktree =` recipe line drops its leading `<dir>` token (the path now derives from the branch: `worktree = <branch> <pin> [store=<path>] [host=<os>]`), `worktrees =` is a branch list, and an optional `branch =` sets a non-`main` canonical branch. Operate on one component (or one branch worktree) with `software --item <name>[@<branch>]`. `software --check` also HAZARDs a dangling generated skill link now. A development host that authors a host-* tool embeds it as its own Where component rather than referencing its own source as a submodule (the reference-don't-vendor carve-out).

Clean every authored doc to ZERO prose tropes (reword to plain prose, the same bar as naming tells), then wire it into the receipts mechanism: the `verify` phase applies `host-lint --prose` and generates a receipt, and `host-lifecycle software --check` re-verifies that receipt by re-running `--prose` (add it to the `verify` phase `recheck =` in `lifecycle.manifest`), re-opening any regressed doc as a HAZARD. `MEMORY.md` is the agent's append-only working memory and is excepted from both the naming and prose audits via `.host-lintignore`, never rewritten.

A component that ships static or self-contained release binaries MUST be able to reproduce them offline from pinned inputs, never from a network fetch at build time. Vendor the dependency layer once and publish it as a reusable, versioned, hash-pinned downloadable release bundle (the pattern `pgs-release` uses for its prebuilt sysroot), then record it per component as `deps-bundle = <url> <sha256>` in `.host-software`. `host-lifecycle software --verify-build` and `release` perform the one controlled, pinned download, verify the sha (provenance), stage the vendored sources, and build under `--network none` (egress). The producer commits a `deps-bundle.lock` as the single source of truth, and `software --check` HAZARDs a `deps-bundle` pin that has drifted from it. A component that genuinely cannot vendor offline (a network-fetching `build.rs`, a non-Rust toolchain) records the case in `repro-waiver = call/NNNN`, whose value cites a software-scoped decision. Where offline vendoring is feasible, that exemption does not apply. (This clause originally named a `hermetic-exempt` key that no release parsed; see the retirement entry at the end of this file.)

Adopt the living-grammar doctrine: the shared tell corpus is incomplete and grows by reflective practice. Discovery is mechanical-first, a sweep of history and recent work for a recurring shape the lane misses, prompted at the verify gate before a milestone closes and at adoption, with the agent assisting rather than leading. The operator validates whether a surfaced shape is a genuine tell or legitimate domain vocabulary, by one test: is the shape a property of how models segment work, or of this project's own domain? A confirmed tell is proposed upstream to the shared grammar the lane consumes (a naming tell to host-lint, a prose trope to host-grammar), gained on the next bump; a legitimate tell-shaped token stays in the per-project `LEXICON`; the project that finds a tell does not edit the shared source itself. Reword by default; box or declare an irreducible citation; declare the numeral-free contextual prefix for a genuine quantity; reserve a graduation for the residue. A later grammar bump that flags a live doc is reworded, and a frozen record is boxed.

    title    = Reflective practice grows in two arms: gather forward, reconcile backward
    action   = Bump your pinned host-lifecycle to v0.24.2, which adds `host-lifecycle reconcile <dir>` and wires the reconcile step into the `upgrade`/`adopt`/`verify` skills. Adopt the widened doctrine: an agent perceives neither the register it emits nor the restatements its own change stales, so reflective practice runs in two arms under one principle. The first arm, gather (unchanged), is forward: emergent tells in the corpus, a confirmed tell graduates upstream, cadence-driven. The second arm, reconcile (new), is backward: the project's own restatements of methodology (its room map, tool family, verification model, recorded Where layout), a confirmed drift fixed locally and never propagated. Prefer pointing at the spine over restating it; a restatement that must stay carries an inline `<!-- host-reconcile: KIND -->` annotation declaring an assertion `host-lifecycle reconcile` checks against a source of truth (the host-* family list and the verification-ladder drivers the lifecycle manifest records, the fixed `software/` and `plan/` layout), with kinds `family`, `verification`, `where-root`, `spec-path`. The trigger is conditional and host-aware: a `restates =` field on an UPGRADING entry marks a drift-capable move so the upgrade skill re-reads the named kinds, adoption runs the full reconcile once, and for a development host that authors its own spine changes the verify gate is the binding trigger (the verify recheck now chains `host-lifecycle reconcile .`). Disposition is three-way (reword a live restatement, box a frozen citation, forward-correct an immutable record). A sibling check: `host-lifecycle validate` now HAZARDs an accepted `call/` decision whose `Scope:` names `host-template`, since its rule is spine-resident and belongs superseded there.

The concepts: `components` (your host-* tools, the `[software]` members of `.host-software` minus a single-file front door marked `front-door = true` if you have one), `verifiers` (your verification drivers, named on a `drivers = ...` line under a `[verification]` stanza you add to `.host-software`, for example a `[verification]` stanza whose line is `drivers = host-lint allium specula host-prove`), `software-root` (where your software lives, `software/`), and `spec-home` (where your specs live, with the software). Each home that lists a set must name the whole set; coverage flags an omission. Convert each surviving inline `<!-- host-reconcile: KIND -->` annotation by replacing its enumeration and comment with a single such link.

If your `.github/workflows/` publishes the site, point the publish step at `mdBook/out` in place of `book`.

Dropping links merely to clear the wall is prohibited; run dream once on the store-carrying machine and commit the stamp before storeless checkouts or CI gate on the new exits.

Read the clean verdict precisely: it covers what the recipe requires of THIS host, presence and currency rather than correctness.

Out of order, your next `host-lifecycle software --check` runs `host-lifecycle refs --gate .` against a binary with no such mode, the verify receipt re-opens, and `host-lifecycle release` stops at its first step; from v0.46.0 a recheck that cannot run says so and names the command, so read that as a stale binary rather than a defect in your tree. Then run `host-lifecycle refs --gate .` and clear every DEAD line (a register reference naming a record that does not exist) and every UNREAD line (a document the walk listed and could not open), because both gate. The gate judges TRACKED documents only, so an uncommitted note cannot redden it or stop a release over a file the release does not ship; `host-lifecycle refs --check .` keeps the whole working tree, drafts included, and is where you ask for the per-file census that the gate reports only as a count. An issue number written outside a link stays advisory and never gates: there is no fix flag, because only the author knows which tracker a bare number meant. Do not read that tolerance as an inconsistency with the prose audit in the same recheck, which does block on its advisory tier, because a prose trope is your own text and is always rewordable; adding the reference clause's tolerance to the prose clause would disarm the gate its own entry installs. One known limitation, so you do not discover it by being gated: a citation of ANOTHER project's register has no form this sweep accepts, and `agentic-host call/0039` gates exactly as a bare `call/0039` does, inside a markdown link too. Until that is settled (connollydavid/host#19) the local remedies are to drop the citation or to quote it in backticks, which marks it an example rather than a reference.

[upgrade "LEXICON-declaration-is-a-report"]
    title    = A LEXICON declaration reports a grammar defect, and inherited text cannot carry one
    action   = Bump your pinned host-lifecycle to v0.49.0, which embeds the reconciled word-choice rules. Three things change. The shared grammar's one word-choice rule becomes three: two that match the cited catalog's own two entries and name them, and a third holding additions the catalog does not carry, because a rule may not cite a source that does not contain it. `harness` and `leverage` are matched as verbs rather than as bare words, so a test harness, a proof harness, an agent harness and an operating leverage stop warning; `certainly` is added, and `framework`, `ecosystem` and `paradigm` are deliberately not: the catalog describes prose in general, while this rule runs over software documentation, where each of the three names a real thing a project builds on. Then adopt the CLAUDE.md paragraph "A declaration is a report, not a settlement", which states the rule the old text left implicit: an entry in your `LEXICON` records that the shared grammar over-fired on your corpus, so it is provisional and owed upstream, and the same entry reached independently in two projects is a confirmed over-fire that belongs in the grammar rather than in either project. Last, review your own `LEXICON` and drop any entry the narrowing made unnecessary; a declaration you no longer need is one the next reader will trust for a reason that has expired. Narrow or add a term on a measured collision, never on a reading of the word. Recorded as agentic-host call/0051.

[upgrade "PIN-two-surfaces-two-claims"]
    title    = A manifest revision is compared to the anchor; a CI workflow revision declares a floor
    action   = Bump your pinned host-lifecycle to v0.49.2. `host-lifecycle software --check <dir>` now reads two pin surfaces it never read before, and reads them differently, because they carry different claims. A component's `Cargo.toml` git dependency on another component of your recipe is compiled into the artifact whose hash `.host-software` records, so it is a claim about the anchor itself and is compared to it: a drifted revision HAZARDs, and so does a family git dependency with no `rev` at all, because the recorded artifact hash could not re-derive from that manifest. Expect this one to gate on the day you turn it on if you have ever released a component that embeds a sibling without bumping the embed; that is the defect it exists to find, and the fix is to bump the `rev` and release. A component's own CI workflow installing one of your tools by `--rev` is the other surface and is NOT compared: it installs a lane driver and ships to nobody, so the revision declares a minimum the lane needs. Those are reported as a counted, enumerated advisory line naming every pin below the anchor with its version, on every run, gating none of them; bump each on its component's next release. Only a revision outside the tool's history gates there, because it names nothing reachable and the install itself would fail. Do not read the advisory tier as tolerance of drift. It is priced: equality over that surface costs one component release per site per release of the installed tool, none of them changing a line of component code, and a gate whose red state costs more to clear than the drift costs to tolerate is a gate that gets bypassed. If your CI pins carry a comment recording WHY a version was chosen, keep it; a floor with its reason written beside it is the strongest form of this and one of ours already was. Recorded as agentic-host call/0052, whose first draft asserted equality over both surfaces and was reopened after review found it wrong in both directions.

[upgrade "LEM-pronoun-system"]
    title    = The lem pronoun system governs how a model refers to, addresses, and speaks as a model
    action   = Bump your pinned host-lifecycle to v0.50.0 and move to this host-template revision together. The operating manual gains "The `lem` pronoun system", the instruction set for any language model referring to, addressing, or speaking as a language model: the model speaking is `L` (conjugated first person; never `I`, which stays with the human operator), the model addressed is `lemu`, the model discussed is `lem`, subagents are `lems`, and `he`/`she`/`it`/`they` never refer to a model. Sync your operating manual: a verbatim-copy adopter re-copies the spine section; a merged manual folds the pronoun system into its own rules, as agentic-host does in a dedicated section of its CLAUDE.md.

[upgrade "REFS-a-foreign-citation-names-its-repository"]
    title    = A citation of another project's register has an accepted form: the link
    action   = Bump your pinned host-lifecycle to v0.51.0. The limitation recorded in `GATE-refs-in-verify` is settled: a citation of a record that lives in another project has an accepted form, a register reference inside a markdown link whose URL names the file it cites, as in `[agentic-host call/0039](https://github.com/connollydavid/agentic-host/blob/main/call/0039-bare-store-is-dot-bare-with-a-git-file.md)`. The sweep accepts the link's form: the URL names the record the token claims, under a repository other than this one. Form is all it checks, and the verdict says so: the count of such citations is disclosed on every exit as accepted and unread, and the disclosure never enumerates them. A citation in bare prose, or a link whose URL names a different file than the token claims, is still a dead pointer and still gates. The two local remedies the earlier entry recorded, dropping the citation or quoting it in backticks, stay valid; the backtick spelling marks an example rather than a reference, so use it only when that is what you mean. Your record layer stays excluded either way, with the withheld count disclosed beside every verdict.

[upgrade "ACTIVE-corpus-and-agents-manual"]
    title    = The manual is AGENTS.md and the always-loaded corpus is declared, held strict
    action   = Bump your pinned host-lifecycle to v0.52.0 and move to this host-template revision together. The operating manual is now `AGENTS.md`; `CLAUDE.md` is a one-line text pointer naming it, so tools that look for the old name find the manual. Rename yours (`git mv CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md` keeps the history), write the pointer, and update your documents' citations; the ledger's early entries whose `verify` lines grep `host-template/CLAUDE.md` for spine sentences resolve against `AGENTS.md` now, which is expected and not a failure of your tree. Then declare your always-loaded corpus: add `active-corpus = .host-corpus` to your `.host` stamp, write `.host-corpus` with one tracked path per line, and the prose verb holds those files to the strict tier, where a warning is a flag, because the always-loaded text is the instruction every session reads. The census counts the declared corpus's non-ASCII bytes and discloses the count on every verdict, gating nothing: script is never a violation, so a Chinese or IPA population is measured, never forbidden. A declared file must not also be named in the ignore list, and a declared file that is absent is a violation, never a smaller corpus. Start with the manual and `STRUCTURE.md`; add the memory surfaces when you build them. Until you declare, the prose verb behaves exactly as it did at v0.51.0.
