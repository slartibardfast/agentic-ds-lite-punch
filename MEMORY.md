## 2026-09-13 — AFTR refreshes UDP mappings on inbound (RFC 7857 §7 violation)

- The soak timing analysis (plan/0005-test-rig/ANALYSIS-2026-09-13) shows
  the VM AFTR's UDP mapping lifetime is maintained by inbound datagrams:
  all 36 cells across two runs survived 5 to 30 s keepalive silences while
  a probe stream was inbound (survived=y, death delay equals the pause
  duration). RFC 7857 §7 says inbound should not refresh; this
  implementation does.
- Consequence: the A3 pause methodology was confounded (no cell exercised
  real death). Mapping-death measurement needs a probe-quiet pause
  (silence the probe inside the pause window). The genuine death plus
  immediate reuse evidence is the relay restart events, not the soak.
- Solid measurements from the data: forward one-way transit 14 to 19 ms
  median (probe to sink through vdsl4, the internet, the AFTR, the
  relay); the buffer-flush deltas equal the pause durations; arrival 1 Hz
  integrity in every run-2 cell.

## 2026-09-13 — A3 soak run 2: forward leg end to end, port reuse again 18/18

- Run 2 (seed 202609132) repeated the matrix with accept_local=1 live on
  eth1: 18/18 cells done, port reuse 18/18 (37.228.213.83:59230), and the
  relay forwarded every probe stream to dslp-sink with source preserved
  (79 to 108 receipts per cell). The forward leg is now proven through a
  full campaign, not just a point test.
- The driver leak fix is validated: arrival counts match the 1 Hz probe
  exactly and every cell's sink bound cleanly.
- Summary-column caveat persists under port reuse: the driver sees no
  tuple change, so death-to-recovery latency needs the per-cell arrival
  series (raw pcaps on the router at /mnt/nvme/runs/2026-09-13-run2).
- Next measurable: the A1 reply-path leg (sink echo through the AFTR
  tuple), then C3 TCP idle-lifetime.

## 2026-09-13 — forward-leg RCA resolved: accept_local, not the relay

- The soak run 1 blocker (the relay never forwarding our probe datagrams,
  the "pre-socket consumption") is fully root-caused: the kernel's
  source-route validation drops inbound datagrams whose source equals a
  router-local address when accept_local=0 (the default). No nft rule is
  involved; accept placement, relay binary, and forward target were all
  irrelevant. The September 2 "self-probe EADDRINUSE" record was this same
  drop; P1's August forwards worked because Globalping's sources were
  genuinely remote.
- Fix: net.ipv4.conf.eth1.accept_local=1, persisted at
  /etc/sysctl.d/99-ds-lite-punch.conf. Interface-scoped; all and
  pppoe-vdsl4 stay 0 (the vdsl4 line is public, its own-address packets
  are martians, and no mirror need exists; revisit only for an inter-line
  test).
- With the fix live, the relay forwards the probe stream to dslp-sink end
  to end (JSON receipts with the masqueraded source preserved).
- The soak's above-1 Hz arrival counts were roughly 18 leaked in-container
  probe processes (the driver terminated lxc-attach wrappers without
  killing the inner pythons); the driver now pkills inside the container
  per phase.

## 2026-09-13 — A3 soak run 1: AFTR port reuse is the rule

- Full keepalive-pause matrix (5/7/10/12/20/30 s x 3, seed 20260913) ran
  via the test rig: 18/18 cells done with stable preconditions, and the
  AFTR re-issued the identical external tuple 37.228.213.83:59230 in all
  eighteen deliberate mapping kills. Port reuse on this line is the rule,
  not the exception (also observed across restarts and retargets).
- The rig's arrival-based liveness sensing is validated: eth1 captures of
  the probe flow (src 84.203.115.61 to dst 192.168.0.21:40000) measured the
  delivery gap through every pause and the resume on the re-created mapping.
- Standing limitations: the relay forward leg is still unassertable
  (inbound-NEW UDP consumed pre-socket, see plan/0005 RCA); the reply
  through-mapping leg stays an external-sender function. Raw data (396 MB)
  lives on the router at /mnt/nvme/runs/2026-09-13; the derived record is
  plan/0005-test-rig/RESULTS-2026-09-13.md.
- Operator notes for the router: busybox ash has no stat, nohup, or pkill
  (kill by PID; use the [p]attern bracket trick to avoid self-kill);
  pattern-kills of "tcpdump" or "probe-client" WILL hit the rig's own
  instruments. The deployment env still targets the test sink
  (TARGET=192.168.21.12:40002) until reverted.

## 2026-09-12 — allocate register numbers at claim time, never from memory

- A milestone folder was created as plan/0005 using a remembered allocation
  from an earlier `host-lifecycle next plan/` run. The value was correct
  (the tool now returns 0006), but the claim never went through the tool:
  the spine's rule is that the generator allocates and the operator never
  numbers by hand. The allocation is a claim-time act, not a remembered
  fact. Every plan/ or call/ claim starts with `host-lifecycle next <dir>`;
  keep the returned value in the room's README as the recorded claim.

## 2026-09-12 — the fork incursion and its guardrails

- A `gh repo fork <owner>/<repo> --clone` run with the host as cwd cloned the
  wrong, pre-existing fork (`slartibardfast/andrej-karpathy-skills`) into the
  host root, untracked. The scans walk untracked directories, so that clone
  leaked three naming tells and re-opened the remap receipt. Cause chain:
  cwd pollution (repo-creating command run inside the host), a destination-name
  collision that made the follow-up commands operate on the submodule instead
  of any fork clone, and no side-effect check until the audit complained hours
  later. The fork detour was avoidable: pushing the branch to
  `connollydavid/host-template` as the owner worked cleanly and merged.
- Guardrails: repo-creating and cloning commands run with cwd in /tmp scratch,
  never the host root; immediately after such a command, `git status` must show
  no collateral; upstream changes to connollydavid/* go direct-push as the
  owner, fork only when required; a command whose output contradicts its intent
  is a stop-and-inspect signal, not a retry prompt.

## 2026-09-12 — git auth over HTTPS: Basic, not Bearer

- GitHub's API accepts `Authorization: Bearer`; the git endpoint does not. A
  token that reads fine via the API is rejected by `git clone`. Use
  `Authorization: Basic base64(x-access-token:<token>)`, the same scheme
  actions/checkout uses. The reproducible-build lane reads the private
  `ds-lite-punch` component this way, via the `DSLITE_READ_TOKEN` secret
  (fine-grained PAT, Contents: read on `slartibardfast/ds-lite-punch`).

## 2026-09-11 — agentic-host adoption (host-template 41ba4e1)

- The repo-root investigation `DSLITE.md` moved to
  `plan/0004-ds-lite-punch/INVESTIGATION.md` and rewritten to zero prose tropes.
  It is the possibility-space record that fed call/0011 and plan/0004
  (decision call/0012).
- The ds-lite-punch software is embedded at `software/ds-lite-punch` (bare
  store + main worktree, pin f7e11e934e99; recipe in `.host-software`). The
  crate has not yet been migrated into that component repo from the former
  rope-agentic monorepo (`tools/ds-lite-punch/`); reproducibility is waived by
  call/0012 until it lands.
- Register continuation: next plan number 0005, next call number 0012.
- Network ground truth for the VM line (AFTR address, no PCP/UPnP, LAN
  addressing model) lives in call/0011 and the milestone docs; policy routing
  and IP assignments are unchanged by this adoption.

## "CGNAT UDP timeout measured"

- AFTR UDP idle timeout: (5,10) s, node-dependent. The RFC 6888 floor is
  120 s; Virgin will not change it. This is the number the relay is built
  around (2 s STUN keepalive cadence, worst-case node about 5 s).
- TCP mapping idle lifetime remains unmeasured (the TCP idle-lifetime test,
  deferred, gates TCP grants only).

## "UDP hole punching works"

- The AFTR is endpoint-independent mapping and filtering (EIM+EIF) for UDP:
  consistent mapping under rotating STUN, and unsolicited inbound to the
  mapped tuple is delivered.
- External ports are always AFTR-chosen random-high, never the inner source
  port (no source-port preservation).
- The v1 core's live tuple 37.228.213.52:24258 held stable under 2 s
  keepalive; external UDP probes from four or more countries forwarded with
  peer source preserved.

## "TCP EIF" (full method)

- Proven 2026-08-31. Setup: the client held a TCP mapping open, inner
  (192.168.0.21, 32014), external 37.228.213.83:59390, discovered via STUN.
  Our vdsl4 line acted as the dual-homed source-port oracle (third party).
- Probes: 5/5 globalping HTTP probes (DE/BR/JP/US/AU) returned HTTP 200 from
  the router-side twin listener. Each response body echoed the exact post-AFTR
  source IP the AFTR forwarded, matching the twin's accept log 1:1.
- Control: probes to an unmapped port in the same batch returned 5/5
  `ECONNREFUSED` (AFTR RST, unchanged behavior).
- Consequence: endpoint-independent filtering holds for TCP as well as UDP; a
  TCP mapping is reachable by any external address. The relay stays UDP-only
  by product decision, not CGNAT limitation.
